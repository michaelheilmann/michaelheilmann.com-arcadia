    <h1>TOGAF for software engineers - Buy-in edition</h1>

    <p>TOGAF is a framework for designing, planning, implementing, and governing enterprise architecture (EA). In practical terms,
    it’s about how an organization structures its tech, processes, data, and applications so everything works together instead of
    fighting each other.</p>

    <p>EA affects everyone—especially engineers. Getting their buy-in is essential.
       The points below outline why TOGAF is useful from a software engineer's perspective and how it actually makes their day-to-day work easier.</p>

    <h2>A structured way to stop random tech decisions</h2>
    <p>TOGAF provides a disciplined method for designing and managing enterprise architecture. For engineers, that means <b>clear standards and reference architectures</b>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Interfaces (e.g., APIs) follow consistent guidelines</li>
      <li>Data models don't drift over time</li>
      <li>Patterns and blueprints are documented and reusable (e.g., "Here’s how we build this type of system")</li>
      <li>Services and applications follow predictable layering</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A shared map of the landscape</h2>
    <p>Everyone gets a single, reliable view of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What systems exist</li>
      <li>Who owns them</li>
      <li>How they integrate</li>
      <li>What’s being added, removed, or changed</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This reduces rework because architectural decisions are captured early:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fewer surprises</li>
      <li>Fewer last-minute pivots</li>
      <li>Fewer "Wait .. we already built something like that" moments</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A predictable roadmap</h2>
    <p>Software engineers gain clarity about the direction of the tech ecosystem:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Which tech stacks are being introduced or retired</li>
      <li>Which legacy systems are on the way out</li>
      <li>Where new features belong (apps, services, platforms)</li>
      <li>How solution designs fit into established enterprise patterns</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Governance that’s actually helpful</h2>
    <p>Governance is basically: "Let’s review the design before implementation so everything integrates cleanly."</p>
    
    <p>It’s meant to prevent chaos—not introduce bureaucracy. When done well, it reduces firefighting, integration headaches, and architectural inconsistencies.</p>
