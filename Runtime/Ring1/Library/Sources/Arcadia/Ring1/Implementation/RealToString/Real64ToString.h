// This function is called if a call to this function successfull converted the specified Real32 value @a value to an UTF-8 string.
// It receives as its first argument and second argument @a thread and @a context passed to the call.
// The third argument is a pointer to a constant array of Bytes. The fourth argument is the number of Bytes in that array.
// The Bytes are the conversion of the Real32 value @a value to an UTF-8 string.
