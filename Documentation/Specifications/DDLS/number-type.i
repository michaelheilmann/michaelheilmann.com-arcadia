<h3 id="number-type">3.5 Number types</h3>
<p>The values of type \(\textit{Number}_{\textit{DDLS}}\) are represented by a \(\textit{Map}\) values.
   The map contains a single map entry of name \(\texttt{kind}\) with the value \(\texttt{Number}\) of type \(\textit{String}\).

<p>The translation function is hence given by</p>
\[
\sigma([\left((\texttt{kind},\texttt{Number}\right)]) = \textit{number}_{\textit{DDLS}}
\]
<p>where \(\textit{number}_{\textit{DDLS}}\) is the single value of type \(\textit{Number}_{\textit{DDLS}}\).</p>
