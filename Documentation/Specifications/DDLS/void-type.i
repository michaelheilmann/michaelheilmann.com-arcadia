<h3 id="void-type">3.9 Void type</h3>
<p>The values of type \(\textit{Void}_{\textit{DDLS}}\) are represented by a \(\textit{Map}\) values.
   The map contains a single map entry of name \(\texttt{kind}\) with the value \(\texttt{Void}\) of type \(\textit{String}\).</p>

<p>The translation function is hence given by</p>
\[
\sigma([\left((\texttt{kind},\texttt{Void}\right)]) = \textit{void}_{\textit{DDLS}}
\]
<p>where \(\textit{void}_{\textit{DDLS}}\) is the single value of type \(\textit{Void}_{\textit{DDLS}}\).</p>
