<p>The rules layed out here are described in terms of the concepts and notations of the <em>Context-Free Grammars</em>
specification (see <a href="@{siteAddress}/specifications/context-free-grammars">@{siteAddress}/specifications/context-free-grammars</a> for more information).</p>

<p>A grammar incorporating these rules must have the set of all Unicode code points as its input alphabet.
Furthermore, the grammar must ensure that ambiguities are resolved.</p>
